			</div>
			<p>
				This survey draws inspiration from the highly regarded State of
				JavaScript annual survey, which has successfully mapped the JavaScript
				ecosystem&apos;s evolution for years. I saw an opportunity to bring this
				same level of comprehensive insight to the Bitcoin community.
			</p>
			<p>
				As a Bitcoin enthusiast and developer, I often found myself searching
				for the most effective tools and trusted resources in the ecosystem.
				This personal need, combined with my background in user research,
				sparked the idea for a community-driven survey.
			</p>
			<p>
				I&apos;m doing research and talking to people in the community to build
				something that&apos;ll help everyone - whether you&apos;re just getting
				started with Bitcoin or you&apos;ve been around for years. It&apos;s
				also a way to keep track of how the Bitcoin world grows and changes as
				time goes on.
			</p>
			<p>
				Each year, I&apos;ll gather all these insights and share them openly.
				The goal is to bring the Bitcoin community closer together by making it
				easier to learn from each other&apos;s experiences and make better
				choices about which tools to use.
			</p>
			<p>
				This is an OSS project. Contributions and feedback are always
				appreciated.
			</p>
			<p>Thanks,</p>
